# 🧭 Project Development Guide

Welcome to the **Project Development Guide**! This document provides a complete, step-by-step plan divided into three major stages: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each stage is organized into daily tasks that build on one another until the project is fully completed.

---

## 📋 Overview

* **Stage 1:** Structure the project using **HTML**
* **Stage 2:** Style and beautify with **CSS**
* **Stage 3:** Add interactivity using **JavaScript**

Each day introduces focused goals, clear deliverables, and Git/GitHub tasks to track progress.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* A text editor (VS Code recommended)
* Git installed on your system
* A GitHub account

Initialize your repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add structured content sections"
git push
```

---

### 📅 **Day 3: Accessibility & Validation**

# 🎨 Stage 2: CSS Styling (Days 4–6)

### 🎯 Goal

Style and visually enhance your website using CSS.

---

### 📅 **Day 4: Base Styles & Layouts**

* [ ] Apply global resets (margin, padding, box-sizing)
* [ ] Set font family, colors, and background
* [ ] Use Flexbox or Grid for layout

✅ **Deliverable:** Clean and consistent base style.

```bash
git add style.css
git commit -m "Add base CSS and layout"
git push
```

---

### 📅 **Day 5: Component Styling**

* [ ] Style navigation bar, buttons, and headings
* [ ] Add hover effects and transitions
* [ ] Define responsive typography and spacing

✅ **Deliverable:** Fully styled UI components.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Style components and add interactions"
git push
```

---

### 📅 **Day 6: Responsive Design**

* [ ] Add media queries for mobile and tablet
* [ ] Adjust layout and font sizes for smaller screens
* [ ] Test responsiveness on multiple devices

✅ **Deliverable:** Fully responsive and polished design.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add responsive design"
git push
```

---

# ⚡ Stage 3: JavaScript Interactivity (Days 7–9)

### 🎯 Goal

Bring your website to life with JavaScript functionality.

---

### 📅 **Day 7: Setup & DOM Manipulation**

* [ ] Create `script.js` and link it to HTML
* [ ] Select and manipulate DOM elements (e.g., change text, toggle class)
* [ ] Add a console log to verify setup

✅ **Deliverable:** Connected and working JS file.

```bash
git add script.js
git commit -m "Setup JavaScript and basic DOM interaction"
git push
```

---

### 📅 **Day 8: Event Handling & Animation**

* [ ] Add click, hover, and scroll event listeners
* [ ] Animate elements with CSS classes and JS
* [ ] Add interactive features (e.g., dropdown menu, modal popup)

✅ **Deliverable:** Interactive, dynamic website.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add interactivity and animations"
git push
```

---

### 📅 **Day 9: Optimization & Deployment**

* [ ] Clean up unused code
* [ ] Test all interactions
* [ ] Deploy on GitHub Pages:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push origin main
gh pages deploy --branch main
```

✅ **Deliverable:** Fully functional and deployed website.

---

# 🧠 Tips for Success

* Commit daily — small, frequent commits are easier to track.
* Test across browsers for consistent results.
* Keep your code readable and commented.
* Use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs or enhancements.

---

### 🏁 Final Goal

By Day 9, you’ll have a **fully built, styled, and interactive website**, version-controlled through Git, and deployed live via GitHub Pages.

> *“Code daily, commit often, and build something great.”*
